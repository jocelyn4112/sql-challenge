# sql-challenge
This homework presented a few challenges, none of which had to do with the actual problems. I spent at least 20 hours, time with two TA's, the teacher and a tutor trying to get my data to import. It was insane; I downloaded almost 50 versions of the code from Quick DBD, many of which worked for others . Finally, I got to the bottom of the problem yesterday (of course it was obvious once I solved it) and was able to complete the homework. Additionally, my car broke down 5 hours away, the mechanic there had "fixed" the same problem three times in one month. Things have been quite crazy which is why I requested an extension for this homework, thanks for your consideration.
